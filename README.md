## California House Prices Regression App

An app that uses user's data to calculate machine learning model's prediction.  
RandomTreeRegressor model is trained in **california-model.ipynb** file and dumped in **model.pkl** so that our web-app doesn't train the same model everytime the web page is refresed.  
The app is hosted on Streamlit.
